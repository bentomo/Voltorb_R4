This is a custom Lithium Ion Charger and Power board for a Nintendo Gamecube Portable. The board design was made in KiCad and can be downloaded and edited with the open source KiCad software.

This may or may not be the final version of the board, it's struggling with heat issues right now and while it works with a heatsink it can push up to 100 degrees celcius without it. The operating temperature is 85 degrees celcius max so this is not the desired operating temperature. (Who would want to deal with it being that hot anyway!)

The charger IC is a Linear Technologies LTC4006-6 which charges a 7.4v Li-ION pack at 3 amperes. The charger also has smart load switching to power a load while chargin the batteries by limiting the charge current and prioritizing the load.

The board has an adjustable low battery LED on the back that can turn on when a battery voltage is reached, this is not accurate but it is simple for an important feature.

There are 2 switching regulators on the PCB. There is a RichTek RT7258 and a Texas Instruments TPS542951 on the board. The Richtek regulator is suppying the 1.9v line to power a gamecube and can source up to 10 amperes. The TI regulator is a dual output regulator for the 3.3v logic line and a 5v line that can each source 2 amperes for miscellaneous components such as fans, rumble motors, screens etc. 

As I said before this project is a work in progress and still has heat issues. It will charge a battery and
